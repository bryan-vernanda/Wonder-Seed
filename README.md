## How to Play:
**Singleplayer Mode:**
<br />In singleplayer mode, you can choose from three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level increases the number of zombies and their speed as they approach the castle. Every level consists of multiple waves of zombies. Once you complete all waves, a "Level Up" button will appear in the top right corner, allowing you to advance to the next level. If you lose a level, you can press the "Respawn" button to try again or the "Back to Title Screen" button to return to the main page. Note that there is no back button during gameplay, so once the game starts, there's no going back.

<br />**Multiplayer Mode:**
<br />In multiplayer mode, the game uses a Bluetooth connection. Scan the area with your friend's iPhone or iPad to lock onto the view before starting the game. You and your friend will face unlimited waves of zombies for 2 minutes, working together to defend your castle. Currently, multiplayer mode supports only 2 players. More players are not supported at the moment due to the need for optimization in player searching. In the future, a host-player system will be implemented to allow more than 2 players. Right now, each player operates independently.
